              <p>
                The Police would like to make your visit to our State as
                pleasant and safe as possible. You can help us further by
                following these simple tips while touring.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Carry your wallet in an inside jacket pocket or side trouser
                  pocket, never in the rear pocket.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Carry pocketbooks in the bend of your elbow, held close to
                  your body. If there is a long strap, wrap it around the bag.
                  Carry credit cards and cash in your pockets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep pocketbooks on your lap when dining out, not dangling
                  over the back of a chair. Avoid placing pocketbooks on hooks
                  on the back of a fitting room or bathroom door, where someone
                  can easily reach over and remove them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Leave valuables and important papers, such as jewelry and
                  passports, secured in your hotel's safe deposit box. Never
                  leave these items unattended in your room or carry large sums
                  of cash on your person.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be wary of unexpected persons coming to your hotel room. Never
                  open the door to unsolicited room service or maintenance
                  people. Contact the front desk if you have any doubts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you schedule a meeting with a potential client, research
                  the company and the individual with whom you are meeting. Meet
                  in a public place, such as a restaurant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Make sure that luggage is only given to a member of the
                  hotel's bell staff and a receipt is issued for stored luggage.
                  Never leave luggage or other expensive items unattended at
                  airports or taxi stands.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kindly contact on counter "May I help you" available in
                  "Arrival Hall" at airport for help and guidance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prefer pre-paid Taxi Booth for hired transportation, since it
                  is governed by POLICE. In this system you have to pay in
                  advance for Taxi Fare which is already approved by
                  Authorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Adequate number of police officers are deputed in proper
                  uniform outside the Arrival Hall and parking area. You can
                  contact nearest police officer to intimate about undesirable
                  elements and touts in your observation. Even though, police is
                  taking utmost care, vigilance and surveillance over these
                  elements, still it is felt that we can eliminate these
                  elements effectively with passengers' active participation in
                  the drive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition to above, police officers in plain clothes are
                  also deputed to keep watch on suspicious movements. Therefore,
                  you should never entertain the touts and unscrupulous persons
                  to avoid harassment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Preplan your destination regarding your stay and tour. Never
                  take advice of Taxi Drivers regarding your stay/tour. Please
                  take information from Police Officers, "May I help you"
                  counter, or any other Govt. recognized information Centers. If
                  you face any harassment or law and order problem, you can dial
                  100 from nearest telephone for police assistance.
